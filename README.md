# House Price Analysis and Predictive Modeling: Identifying Key Factors with R
## Introduction

Welcome to the House Price Analysis and Predictive Modeling project. The primary goal of this analysis is to understand the key factors that influence house prices in a specific area. By utilizing R for data exploration, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, this project aims to provide insights into the real estate market dynamics. The findings from this project can assist stakeholders in making informed decisions based on data-driven evidence.
## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key files:

- **Final B2100.Rmd**: The primary R Markdown document that serves as the dashboard. It includes the complete analysis, data processing, statistical modeling, and visualizations. This file can be rendered into an HTML report.
- **Final B2100.R**: The R script containing supporting code, functions, or additional analysis that complements the R Markdown file.

### Key Sections in the R Markdown (Rmd) File:
1. **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration and summary of the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare the data.
3. **Modeling**: Implementation of statistical models to identify factors affecting house prices.
4. **Visualization**: Graphical representations and visual insights.
5. **Dashboard**: Interactive elements and the final HTML dashboard.
6. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and implications.

### Key Sections in the R Script (R File):
1. **Functions**: Custom functions used in the analysis.
2. **Extended Analysis**: Additional scripts or exploratory code that supports the primary analysis.
